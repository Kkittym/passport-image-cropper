# passport-image-cropper

Takes an image and lets you crop it to uk passport dimensions

Open an image using the file menu at the top, resize it using the other menu to get it a good size.

A box will appear which is the correct proportions for a uk passport photo, and can be resized using the scroll wheel. Click the left mouse button to crop the image and save using the top menu again.

Close the image before opening a new one.

This was my first attempt at tkinter and a fully fledged python program, and I've had to work through many bugs in this. It was fun nonetheless, and is an interesting if simple program. I wish I had made better use of git to track the features I worked on using branches, but this was my first personal project using it so it is still something to work on next time. The program probably still has bugs, and could be written so much better, so hopefully as I learn more about python maybe I can revisit this and tidy it up in the future.
